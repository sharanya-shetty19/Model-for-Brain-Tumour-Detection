# Model-for-Brain-Tumour-Detection
Deep Learning Model for Brain Tumour Detection in MRI Scans
<h2>Problem statement of the project</h2>
<p>The detailed problem statement is to develop a machine-learning model for brain tumour detection using MRI images. The objective is to accurately classify MRI scans as either having a brain tumour or being normal. The code aims to address this problem by implementing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture.

<h2>Objectives  of the project</h2>
<ul>
<li>Improve the generalization capability of the model to ensure reliable predictions.</li>
<li>Enhance the model's performance through optimization and hyperparameter tuning.</li>
<li>Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate evaluation metrics.</li>
<li>Validate the model's performance on a separate test dataset.</li>
<li>Provide an intuitive and user-friendly interface for tumour detection.</li>
<li>Compare the performance of the deep learning model with existing methods.</li>
<li>Contribute to the advancement of medical diagnostics and healthcare technology.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Dataset details :</h2>
<p>The Kaggle dataset "Brain Tumor Detection MRI" is a collection of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the brain that are labelled with the presence or absence of a brain tumour. This dataset can be used for training and evaluating machine learning models for brain tumour detection.</p>
<h4>Here are some key details about the dataset</h4>
<ol>
<li> Size: The dataset contains a total of 2,487 MRI images in DICOM format.</li>
 <li>Labels: Each MRI scan is labelled as either having a brain tumour (positive class) or not having a brain tumour (negative class).</li>
 <li>Image Modality: The MRI scans are typically captured using T1-weighted imaging, which provides structural information about the brain.</li>
 <li>Class Imbalance: The dataset may have a class imbalance, where the number of positive tumour samples may be significantly smaller than the number of negative samples.</li>
 <li>Usage: The dataset can be used for tasks such as binary classification to train models that can automatically detect the presence of a brain tumour in MRI scans.</li>
</ol>
